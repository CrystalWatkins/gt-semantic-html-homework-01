# Code Refactor Homework 1

## Description 

This website is for a marketing firm called Horiseon. Previously, it did not have semantic elements and was not set up for web accessibility. In the HTML file, I was able to change the div to semantic tags that included header, section, nav, main, figure, small, aside, article, and footer. This allowed it to have the correct HTML semantics that improved the page. I then added alt attributes to all of the pictures to improve our web accessibility. I then confirmed that all of the code in HTML was in the same order that was displayed on the webpage. I was able to fix the link in the navigation bar that allowed you to click on the search engine optimization and allow you to reach the info section on search engine optimization further down on the page. I confirmed that the following two links worked- online reputation management and the social media marketing both linked correctly to the respective spots on the page. 

From there, I felt that the index.html was fixed to my working knowledge so far. I then moved to the style.css page and was able to apply the same command to multiple styling sessions. From there, I did not want to delete the work, so I made them notes that can be referred back to.

üèÜ The sections listed above are the minimum for a good README, but your project will 
ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding 
the following sections.

## Badges

![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/CrystalWatkins/gt-semantic-html-homework-01?style=social)

Badges aren't _necessary_, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other 
developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.
io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will 
in time.


## Contributing

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, 
you will want to add guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.
contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to 
run them.
